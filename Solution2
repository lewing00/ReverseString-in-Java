//Solution2 begins to explore the toolkit provided by the StringBuilder class. Behind the code, not much more is going on in this solution than Solution1. The biggest 
//difference is that instead of concatenating via an operation I am using the append method of the StringBuilder class to the build the string, one character at a time
//starting with the last char.
//In this solution I also show how System.out.println and System.out.print differ in the output look compared to using only System.out.println in Solution1

     String str = keyboard.nextLine();
     
     for(int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){
     
         sBuild.append(str.charAt(i));
